### More examples

More examples are always welcome, so follow this space as we add further.

If you want to contribute your own please reach out. In general I believe these examples should show two aspects:

* Show the capabilities of cljs4excel in general.
* Illustrate the potential of doing data analysis within ClojureScript and Microsoft Excel, where they both can play on each others strengths.
