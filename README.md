# cljs4excel
Run a ClojureScript REPL within Microsoft Excel.

![](https://www.cljs4excel.com/img/preview-1.gif)

This is a bootstrapped ClojureScript as shown on http://clojurescript.net/
running within an Office Add-in, which is essentially a browser running within
Microsoft Excel. Using Office.js and some JS->CLJS->JS code you can then
interact with the Excel document from ClojureScript.
